# ismip6-gris-results-processing

## This Archive is storing the download in orginal resolution from the models
The difference to the ftp is that we try to fix incorrect res suffix naming 
(see option 'flg_strip') and remap names to common experiment names

### download files into local Archive
./download_rec.sh

### remap experiment directory names to common standard
./name_remapping.sh


### Model files can be deleted after post-processing to Archive_05
