## Archive - aka A2
Temporary copy data on CCR upload server.

As we have to assume A1 to change from one moment to the next, we should work with a copy of it here. Because A1 is so large, A2 would at any time probably only contain a subset of models/variables that is currently processed. A2 should have the same physical data as A1, but with modified directory/file/variable names to match standards.
