# ismip6-gris-results-processing
Collection of scripts to process ISMIP6 Greenland model projections

## Archive - aka A2
Temporary copy of data on CCR upload server. Same physical data, but file and directory names adjusted to standards.


As we have to assume A1 to change from one moment to the next, we should work with a copy of it here. Because A1 is so large, A2 would at any time probably only contain a subset of models/variables that is currently processed. A2 should have the same physical data as A1, but with modified directory/file/variable names to match standards.
